# N-Queens

This is a genetic algorithm that I wrote for my AI class in school.
It applies the concept of a genetic algorithm to effectively solve the 8-queens problem
where you must fit 8 queens pieces on a 8x8 board without any of them conflicting with another.
This includes the initial program i wrote in c++, the updated version to visualize it in unity, 
as well as a graph depicting the average ans max fitness of each generation of the algorithm.
